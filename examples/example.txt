Online LLM inference powers many exciting applications such as intelligent chatbots and autonomous agents. Modern LLM inference engines widely rely on request batching to improve inference throughput, aiming to make it cost-efficient when running on expensive GPU accelerators. However, the limited GPU memory has largely limited the batch size achieved in practice, leaving significant GPU compute resources wasted.
