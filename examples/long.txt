After the recently concluded international break, Bayern Munich's attacking star Harry Kane gave an exclusive interview to 433, discussing the shooting ability rankings of his teammates. Kane confidently placed himself at the top, showcasing his absolute self-assurance in his shooting skills.

Kane's shooting ability was rated at 92 points, undoubtedly placing him at the pinnacle of Bayern's roster. His performances in the Premier League have long proven his capabilities, especially his calmness and precision in critical moments, making him a nightmare for opposing defenses. Kane stated that he consistently maintains high-intensity shooting training, which not only helps him enhance his own abilities but also contributes to the team's victories.

Following closely is the young Olise, who was rated 80 points for his shooting ability. As a rising star, Olise's performances last season were impressive, particularly his decisiveness and accuracy when facing strong teams, showcasing his unlimited potential for the future. Kane commented on Olise, saying, "He has excellent potential, and his decision-making in shooting is continuously improving. If he keeps working hard, he will become a top striker."

Gnabry ranks third with a score of 83. He is not only a shooter but also a versatile player within the team. Gnabry's speed and technique enable him to create numerous opportunities on the field, and his composure when shooting makes him a reliable assistant to Kane. Kane holds Gnabry in high regard, stating, "His explosiveness and accuracy keep defenders on their toes; every time he gets the ball, I believe he can create an opportunity."

Aside from these three, Kimmich and Musiala also hold places in the shooting ability rankings. Kimmich's shooting ability was rated at 74 points, while Musiala received a score of 82. Although Kimmich's primary responsibility is in midfield organization, his involvement in attacking play should not be underestimated. Musiala, representing young players, has demonstrated promising shooting potential.

This ranking not only recognizes the individual capabilities of the players but also reflects the team's tactical execution. As the captain, Kane comparing his shooting ability with that of other players is, in fact, a way to motivate his teammates to continually strive for improvement.

In the world of football, shooting ability is undoubtedly a key factor in determining the outcome of matches. As Kane said, "Football is never just a game of 11 people; it is the adrenaline of an entire city." In upcoming matches, Bayern Munich players need to continue strengthening their training and improving their shooting abilities to secure more victories for the team during crucial moments of the season.

As the season progresses, Bayern's attacking system will continue to revolve around Kane's abilities, making the performances of other players even more critical. Every training session and every match is an opportunity for them to improve. Fans are also looking forward to seeing Kane lead Bayern Munich further along this new journey, creating more glory.

In summary, Kane's confidence and recognition of his teammates not only reflect his personal charm but also showcase Bayern Munich's team spirit. In this highly competitive season, how to bring out the best performance from each player will be key to the team's success.
