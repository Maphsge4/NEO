"""
Reproduction script for Figure 10a in the paper.

Please note that this script should be run on g5.x16large instances, and only the corresponding line
is drew in the figure. 

The full test takes a long time (~5h) to run. You can reduce the number of requests or number of data
points to speed up the evaluation process.
