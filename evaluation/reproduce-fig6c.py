"""
Reproduction script for Figure 6c in the paper.

Please note that the input data for this script is only a small subset (100 requests) of the original data (2000 requests) used 
in the paper. This is for the purpose of demonstration and quick verification of the results. As a result, the latency would be
lower than the original figure due to less average queuing latency. 

The original data can be generated by modifying the parameters in the script.
